    <h1 id="how-to-build-a-saas-application">How to build a SaaS application</h1>
<p>A software as a service (SaaS) application is a software application delivered over the internet. SaaS applications are usually subscription based, with users paying a monthly or annual fee. If you&rsquo;re thinking of building a SaaS application, there are a few things you&rsquo;ll need to keep in mind. In this blog post, I&rsquo;ll guide you through the high level process of building a SaaS application, from start to finish and how I&rsquo;m tackling it!</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-niche">Choose Your Niche</h2>
<p>The first step in building a SaaS application is to choose your niche. What problem are you trying to solve? Next, you need to understand who your target customers are. Where do they hang out? What are their needs and desires? How can you help them solve their problems?</p>
<p>You also need to be sure that the problem can be solved by software as a service, even tough more and more products are based on a subscription model, for some cases a traditional software can be the better option.</p>
<p>Finally, once youâ€™ve found a niche, a lot of the hard work is already done! You now need to refine it and make sure that it suits both your business goals and the needs of your target audience.</p>
<h2 id="identify-your-mvp">Identify Your MVP</h2>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve chosen your niche, it&rsquo;s time to identify your MVP, or minimum viable product. This is the bare-bones version of your SaaS application; the core functionality that your target audience will find most valuable. For example, if you&rsquo;re building a project management tool, your MVP might be the ability to create and assign tasks.</p>
<p>The goal of the minimum viable product is to be sure that there is a need for the problem you solve and also to validate the business model. So the MVP can be really lean, but it should give you the feedback from the users if this is something they want.</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-technology-stack">Choose Your Technology Stack</h2>
<p>Next up, you&rsquo;ll need to choose your technology stack. This refers to the software and tools you&rsquo;ll use to build your SaaS application. There are many different options available, so it&rsquo;s important to do your research and choose the right one for your needs.</p>
<p>One of the important points to consider is the skills you currently posses. If you already know a frontend framework like Angular, Next or Vue, just stick with that for now and don&rsquo;t waste time learning a new one!</p>
<h2 id="build-your-application">Build Your Application</h2>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time for the fun part: actually building your SaaS application! This will involve coding (or hiring someone to code for you), as well as designing and developing your user interface.</p>
<h2 id="test--launch-your-saas-product">Test &amp; Launch Your SaaS Product</h2>
<p>Before you launch your SaaS application to the world, it&rsquo;s important to test it thoroughly. This will help you iron out any bugs and ensure that your application is ready for real-world use.</p>
<p>Existing customers from the MVP phase can probably help you with that, or already provided feedback if the SaaS app you built is working good so far.Once you&rsquo;re happy with how everything works, it&rsquo;s time to launch! This is a whole other topic, as here the marketing begins. A topic for another day!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h2>
<p>Building a SaaS application can seem like a daunting task, but if you break it down into steps, it&rsquo;s actually quite manageable. By following the tips outlined in this blog post, you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to having a successful SaaS business up and running in no time!</p>
