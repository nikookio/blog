      <description>What is Digital Ocean? Digital Ocean is a cloud computing platform that offers virtual private servers, or &amp;ldquo;droplets,&amp;rdquo; as they&amp;rsquo;re called. Droplets are typically used to host web applications, and they offer several benefits over traditional shared hosting environments.
For one, droplets are much more configurable than traditional shared hosting environments. This means that you can tailor your droplet to the specific needs of your application. For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re running a database-driven web application, you can choose to allocate more RAM and CPU resources to your droplet than if you were just running a simple static website.</description>
