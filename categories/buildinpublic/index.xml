      <description>Hi there üëãüèª
I&amp;rsquo;m Niko and starting to build in public! This can be a scary step in the beginning, because everything you do will be judged by the public. But on the other hand you get a lot of valuable inputs and feedback along the journey. So it&amp;rsquo;s defenitly worth it!
My Goal üéØ for now is to launch 2+ Products in 2022, gain some customers that pay me and learn a lot of things on the go!</description>
